#### Step 6
1. Irrelevant => If you do not want to add an additional page then delete the experience link in the HTML.

#### Step 7
1. Put your project files in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account ::: Done before the project start;
2. Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository ::: Made sure;
3. Please do not create any new folders for this project ::: At some point during the work on this project I added 'Styles' folder for this project. Now it's deleted and 'styles.css' back to the root of the project;
4. The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you. See the workshop 'Share Your Techdegree Projects with Github Desktop' for more info on how to put your project onto GitHub using the GitHub Desktop app (linked in the Additional Resources section) ::: Watched before the project start.

#### Step 8
1. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator. Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code ::: Done. Also typographed via https://www.artlebedev.ru/typograf/. Also added W3C banner for correct CSS;
2. There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix: Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there. If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored. If HTML validator flags use of pipe (|) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored ::: Done.
